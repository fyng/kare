# kare: notes for agents

This repo is the shared design system for Feiyang Huang's projects. It is usually
checked out as a git submodule at `design-system/` inside another project
(the reference consumer is `fyng/fyng.github.io`). Read `README.md` first.

## Where to look

`INDEX.md` lists every doc, chart form, specimen and kit file. It is generated, so
it is always current; start there when you do not know where something lives.

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| Principles, voice, how to write figure text | `core/README.md` |
| Which colour for a mark; token names and values | `core/color.md`; values in `core/tokens.mjs` |
| Type roles, numbers, units | `core/typography.md` |
| Which chart form fits the data | `core/charts/README.md`, *Choosing the form* |
| Axes, marks, labels, glyphs shared by every chart | `core/charts/README.md`, *Grammar* |
| Everything about one chart form, its figures included | `core/charts/forms/NN-name.md` (`grep -l "id: form-22" core/charts/forms/*`) |
| Chart forms of one kind | `grep -l "family: anatomy" core/charts/forms/*`; the family's contact sheet, `core/charts/out/sheet-anatomy.png` |
| The form for a job | `grep -l "job:.*anatomical site" core/charts/forms/*` |
| Cells, tissue, body maps, arrows, method boxes | `core/illustration.md` |
| A method schematic: architecture, procedure, data | `core/illustration.md`, *Schematics*; forms 27–29 |
| Icons | `core/icons.md`; code in `kit/icons.js` |
| Drawing a figure in HTML; the kit API and renderer | `kit/README.md` |
| A website | `formats/web/README.md` |
| A journal figure: sizes, panel contract, Typst assembly | `formats/publication/README.md` |
| A graphical abstract: canvas, arc, motion | `formats/abstract/README.md` |
| Who a form or artwork is credited to | `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` |

## Rules

- **Core and formats.** `core/` holds what every format shares: principles and voice
  (`core/README.md`), `color.md`, `typography.md`, `charts/`, `icons.md`,
  `illustration.md`, and the tokens. `kit/` is the HTML implementation of the core
  grammar that the specimens and graphical abstracts are drawn with. `formats/web/`
  (websites, Sass), `formats/publication/` (journal figures) and `formats/abstract/`
  (graphical abstracts) add only what their medium needs. Read the core element and
  the format README before designing anything.
- **Chart forms.** One file per form in `core/charts/forms/`, named `NN-name.md`
  with a 1–3 word name, holding its rules and its figures (`core/charts/README.md`,
  *Figures*). Its front matter (`id`, `name`, `kind`, `family`, `job`, `kit`,
  `sources`, `see_also`, and `specimens` for a form drawn outside the kit) is what
  `tools/index.mjs` reads. Each figure is a `js figure=<name> w= h=` block under the
  image it renders to; a variant is a `##` section and its figure takes the
  section's slug. A form's print sizes live in its file, under *In each format*.
  Numbers are permanent: a new form takes the next number, and a retired one is
  never reused.
- **Positive templates.** Describe what to do and show it (a specimen, a form spec).
  Write a constraint only when it is necessary.
- **Generated files.** `core/tokens.css` and `core/tokens.json` come from
  `core/tokens.mjs`; edit the `.mjs` and run `node core/tokens.mjs`. `INDEX.md` comes
  from `tools/index.mjs`; run `npm run check` after adding, moving or renaming a
  file, and fix what it reports. `npm run figures` renders the figure blocks whose
  code changed and rewrites the contact sheets; the check fails on a stale one.
- **What belongs here.** Tokens, rules, framework adapters, the kit, the renderer,
  the index tool and the vendored fonts (`core/fonts/`).
  Project content (figure sources, page layouts, publish scripts) stays in the
  consuming project, and explorations stay out of the repo.
- **Code only where it is the system.** The token generator, the Sass, the kit, the
  renderer and the index tool ship here. Specimens are figure blocks in the form
  files, HTML pages drawn with the kit (`specimen-color.html`), or Typst sources in
  `formats/publication/`, and every image in an `out/` folder is rendered from one,
  so no image outlives its source. A second
  plotting stack (e.g. a matplotlib adapter) joins only as a maintained format
  adapter, with its own specimen.
- **Contributing from a consumer.** Branch inside the submodule, commit and push
  here, open a PR against `main`, then bump the submodule pointer in the consumer.
  Never edit a copy of these files inside a consumer.
- **Shared by several projects.** Prefer additive changes. When changing an existing
  token value, path or kit API, call it out in the PR description.
- **Docs and code together.** A change to tokens, Sass or the kit updates the doc
  that describes it in the same commit.
